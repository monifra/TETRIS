# TETRIS 
## Based on  [kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania/Tetris-Basic/commits?author=kubowania) course Tetris-Basic
## My changes

As a course is a basic javascript course, from the beginning I've decided to write some of the code on my own. I move some of the functionality from html to javascript to make it more adjustable. 
1. Changed the rotations in tetrominos so they matches the original game rotation.
2. Tetrominos initial spawn matches the one in original game.
## More features
1. Added the rest of tetriminos: z and j.
### TO DO: 
1. Add game levels
