# TETRIS 
## Based on  [kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania/Tetris-Basic/commits?author=kubowania) course Tetris-Basic
## My changes

As a course is a basic javascript course, from the beginning I've decided to write some of the code on my own. I move some of the functionality from html to javascript to make it more adjustable. <br><br>
More changes:

1. Changed the rotations in tetrominos so they matches the original game rotation.
2. Changed the not recommended event.keyCode to event.key.
3. Changed button start/stop to be responsive and change its content.

## More features
1. Added the rest of tetriminos: z and j.

### TO DO: 
1. Add game levels
2. Take care of this strange start button to get start screen overlay.

### TO TAKE CARE OF:
1. Every time when clicking pause the next tetrimino is changed, I'm not sure it should even be a pause button...
2. When rotating tetrimino at the edge they've got split.
3. It's possible to play when the game is paused with keyboard moving tetriminos
